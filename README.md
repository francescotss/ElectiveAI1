## Beacon-based Scale Estimation for Monocular Structure from Motion in Robotics Systems

Accurate scale estimation in monocular Structure from Motion (SfM) pipelines plays a crucial role in robotics systems. In this paper, we present a novel method to address the scale ambiguity challenge by strategically leveraging beacons placed at known positions within the environment. Our objective is to propose a new methodology that integrates existing optimization techniques to effectively tackle this problem. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach by conducting benchmarking experiments and comparing our system with state-of-the-art methods. The results indicate that, in some cases, our method achieves comparable accuracy in scale estimation, highlighting its potential for improving the reliability and precision of SfM-based robotics applications or providing a viable alternative.
